# FAQ

## 🍓 I have a link I'd like to share / contribute! How do I tell you about it?
Email us at admin@veganhacktivists.org with your link and we'll take a look!

## 🍍 I found a broken or inappropriate link! How do I report it to you?
Email us at admin@veganhacktivists.org with your link and we'll take a look!

## 🍌 Will you add my link / why was my link rejected?
We have very strict guidelines on what we add to the list. Some of the things we look at are: 
- is it updated often or maintained well? how useful is the resource?
- do we have similar resources already / does it add anything more than those resources?
- is it well designed and easy to browse? is it littered with ads and affiliate links?
- is it worth adding to the list that we're trying to keep somewhat reasonable sized?
In most cases we reject new links that don't meet those standards - sorry!

## 🥝 I submitted a link! How long does it take until it goes live?
We'll typically decide on a link within 48 hours. If it's been longer it's likley been rejected!

## 🥔 Do you email us back when a link is approved or rejected?
Because we reject so many links and get so many submissions, we don't email on rejections.
We do however email you back if a link has been accepted as part of the adding process!

## 🥦 Can I request or become a contributor to this sheet?
Right now we have 5 dedicated contributors so we're unable to accept any more, sorry!

## 🍑 Who's maintaining the list of links on this sheet?
The folks maintaining this sheet are from https://VeganHacktivists.org
